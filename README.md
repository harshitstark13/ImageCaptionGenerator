The function of an image caption generator can be broken down into the following steps:
 1. Input: The image caption generator takes an image as input.
 2. Image Processing: The image is processed using various computer vision techniques to extract meaningful features from the image, such as colors, shapes, objects, 
    and textures.
 3. Language Model: A language model is then used to generate a textual description of the image based on the extracted features. The language model uses natural 
    language processing (NLP) techniques to generate the text.
 4. Output: The final output of the image caption generator is a textual description or caption that describes the content of the image in a human-like language.
